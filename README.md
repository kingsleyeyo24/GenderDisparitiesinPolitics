 ### Recommedations
 - Since smartwatches had the highest sales while laptops had the lowest, consider expanding the range of smartwatches or related accessories.
 - Given that 12 states reported no orders, targeted marketing campaigns and localized promotions should be developed to reach potential customers in these regions.
 - Bayelsa's high number of negative feedbacks suggests there may be underlying issues with customer satisfaction. Investigate the cause of these complaints, whether related to product quality, customer service, or delivery issues.
 - Given the significant sales increase in May and the decline in February, consider planning targeted promotions during periods of low sales.
 - Stock up on high-demand products such as smartwatches and smartphones.
 - Abia State was the top location for orders, suggesting that regional marketing efforts were effective there. Extend successful marketing tactics in Abia to other regions with potential, like Ebonyi and Anambra.
